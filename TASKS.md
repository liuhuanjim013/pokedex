## Reproduction Guide for Original Project

### Original Project Analysis
Based on the [blog post](https://www.cnblogs.com/xianmasamasa/p/18995912), the original project:
- Used **Mx_yolo 3.0.0 binary** for training (we'll replace with Colab-based training)
- Achieved working results with **1-3 generations (386 Pokemon)**
- Used **YOLOv3** for classification (not detection)
- Deployed on **Sipeed Maix Bit** with RISC-V processor
- Had **limited recognition accuracy** due to lighting, angle, and background factors

### Key Insights from Original Project
1. **Dataset Quality**: Original author noted dataset was "garbage" with poor quality images
2. **Recognition Limitations**: "识别受光线、目标大小因素、背景等因素影响很大"
3. **Model Performance**: "识别的局限性太大了，很多时候识别不出来"
4. **Hardware Constraints**: Used Sipeed Maix Bit with limited resources

    # Not detection format, but classification format
    pass
```

### Training Setup (Colab-based)
```python
# Configure YOLOv3 for Pokemon classification in Colab
# Original project used 386 classes (1-3 generations)
# Target: 1025 classes (all generations)

# Training configuration for Colab
config = {
